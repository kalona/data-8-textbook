    "## The Code Used in the `SEX` Column\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of the `AGE`, `2014`, and `2019` columns are straightforward to understand. The `AGE` column contains ages in completed years. The special value `999` represents the entire population regardless of age, and `100` represents \"100 or more\". The `2014` and `2019` columns contain estimates of the US population in each of the two years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SEX column, however, is more difficult to interpret. \n",
    " \n",
    "The Census form asks respondents to provide the sex of each household member by checking one of two boxes labeled Male and Female. The `SEX` column contains numeric codes: `1` for male, `2` for female, and `0` for the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question has been asked in essentially the same way since 1790. But since then there has been considerable [research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11534012/) on whether the sex of human beings lends itself to simple binary categorization. For example, nonbinary people do not identify exclusively as male or female. A [study](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/nonbinary-lgbtq-adults-us/) by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law in 2021 estimated that at least 1.2 million individuals in the United States identify as nonbinary. \n",
    "\n",
    "By continuing to use the historical form of the question, the Census fails to reflect the complexity of sex classification. The [explanation](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2020/partners/outreach-materials/handouts/why-we-ask-the-sex-question.pdf) provided in the 2020 Census and reproduced in the quotation below does not include instructions for those who do not identify as one of Male or Female.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Responding to the sex question is easy.**\n",
    ">\n",
    ">A question on sex has been included since the first census in 1790. All 2020 Census questions that involve personal characteristics are based on self-identification. When you complete your census, select the box for the biological sex you identify with.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the opinion expressed above, responding to this question isn’t easy for everyone. Difficulties with answering the question can lead to non-response or inaccurate responses. This can reduce the accuracy of Census data for informing policy decisions and allocating resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the 2020 Census, the Census Bureau considered revising this question or including broader questions about sexual orientation and gender identity. In the end the Bureau decided [not to change](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/director/2017/03/planned_subjects_2020.html) the planned Census. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Census Director John Thompson wrote, “The Census Bureau remains committed to reflecting the information needs of our changing society.” Census forms do change. For example, [new questions on race and ethnicity](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/improved-race-ethnicity-measures-reveal-united-states-population-much-more-multiracial.html) in the 2020 Census have led to a more accurate understanding of US demographics. We can hope that the 2030 Census will be more inclusive and accurate in all respects. "
